21
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:06,260
是这季度最重要的事
is the most important event of the season

22
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:07,820
我希望我们可以融入进来
and I want us to fit in.

23
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:09,580
我其实不知道自己来这儿干什么
I don't know what I'm doing here.

24
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:11,160
-我叫旺达  -我是杰拉丁
- I'm Wanda. - Geraldine.

25
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:12,870
旺达  能收到吗
Wanda, can you read me?

26
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:15,680
多蒂身上发生了奇怪的事
Something strange happened with Dottie.

27
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:17,940
在那之前也发生了奇怪的事
Well, something strange happened before that, too.

28
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:19,160
我很难解释
It's hard to explain.

29
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:22,600
搞好邻里关系也不是这么难呀
It wasn't so hard to fit in after all.

30
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:23,610
怎么了
What is that?

31
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:26,540
不
No.

32
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:31,680
-这一切是真的吗  -是真的  亲爱的
- Is this really happening? - Yes, my love.

嗯  绝对怀了
Yep! Definitely pregnant. 

58
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:34,910
那我们已经猜到了
Well, that much we figured.

59
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:37,270
就是让我们好意外
It's just kinda taken us by surprise.

60
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:39,050
很突然  非常突然  是吧
It's just kinda suddenly. Quite suddenly, wasn't it?

61
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:40,430
几乎是一夜之间就发生了
I mean, practically overnight.

62
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:43,080
怎么会发生这种事的
I mean... How did this happen?

63
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:47,270
当一个男人和一个女人
You see, when a man and a woman

64
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:50,500
非常相爱时
love each other very much...

65
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:55,260
我们开心极了[粉色]  也可能是蓝色[男孩]
Well, we're just tickled pink, or blue.

66
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:58,300
你快四个月了  是吧
You're at about four months now. Is that right?

67
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:02,660
我猜也是
I thought as much.

68
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:03,760
我们让女士们
We let the little ladies

69
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,540
用水果来记录宝宝的成长
keep tabs on their growing babies with fruit.

70
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:08,720
这样她们更好理解
Makes it simple for them.

71
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:11,950
四个月时  胎儿像梨那么大
At four months, the fetus is about as big as a pear.

72
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:14,670
五个月时  像木瓜  六个月时  像西柚
At five months, a papaya. Six, grapefruit.

73
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:18,530
七个月时  像菠萝  八个月时  像甜瓜
Seven, pineapple. Eight, honeydew. 

74
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:20,350
假设说
Hypothetically speaking,

75
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:24,010
12个小时的该是多大的水果
what size fruit would it be at, say, hmm, 12 hours?

76
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:25,700
什么  12小时
Uh, pardon? 12 hours?

77
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:28,410
我觉得这种问题是无果的
Well, I think this line of questioning is fruitless.

78
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,650
就假设说  我们需要担心吗
Well, hypothetically speaking, should we be concerned?

79
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:35,150
假设说
Hypothetically speaking, 

80
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:38,050
每个准新父亲都会紧张[神经]
every new father-to-be gets nervous.

81
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:39,050
我的神经可是钢制的[钢铁意志]
Well, I have nerves of steel,

82
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:40,770
你的理论不好使了  医生先生
so there goes your theory, Mr. Doctor...

83
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:43,120
幻视  你送医生出去吧
Vision, why don't you see the doctor out?

84
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,700
好的  来吧
Good idea. Yes.

85
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:49,280
非常感谢你来一趟  尼尔森医生
Thank you so much for dropping by, Dr. Nielson.

86
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,170
我很高兴你及时赶上了我还没出发
Well, I'm just glad you caught me in time.

87
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:55,210
我今天下午就要带妻子去度假了
I'm taking the wife on vacation this afternoon.

88
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:56,920
祝你度假愉快  赫
Have a nice holiday! Hey, Herb!

89
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:57,740
伙计
Hey, buddy!

90
00:03:57,890 --> 00:04:00,450
你能不能先别把旺达的事...
Listen, you can keep the news of Wanda's...

91
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:03,030
说出去
You know, just between us because, uh,

92
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:05,000
我不知道  这一切发生得好快
I don't know, everything's happening so quickly.

93
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
我们暂时不想告诉外人
We'd like to keep the news just in the family for right now.

94
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,710
当然  不会说的
Of course. Mum's the word.

95
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:13,660
我走了  百慕大哦
I'm off. Bermuda, baby!

96
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:14,330
好啊
Yes.

97
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:20,880
赫
Hey, Herb!

98
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,000
我觉得你树篱
Think you might've taken the hedge-trimming

99
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,750
修过头了  伙计
a little too far there, old chum.

100
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:26,520
是啊
So, I have.

101
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:28,520
谢谢  伙计
Thanks, buddy.

102
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:33,540
嗯  不客气
Yeah. Don't mention it.

103
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:41,210
刚刚外面发生了好奇怪的事
Strangest thing just happened outside with...

104
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:44,160
老天  你肚子是又大了吗
Whoa, Nelly! Have you gotten bigger?

105
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:48,050
是吗  我从这个角度看不出
Have I? I can't tell from this angle.

106
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:50,250
我等不及
I can't wait... 

107
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:54,640
做个骄傲的木瓜[爸爸]了
...to be a proud papaya.

108
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:09,240
"布置环境  怀孕期间  为新生儿清洁
"Nesting, the overwhelming urge during pregnancy to clean,

109
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,480
整理  准备家园的难以克制的冲动"
organize, and prepare the home for the new baby."

110
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,580
看  你这就像个专家了
See? You're an expert already. 

111
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:13,840
我们根本不必担心
We've got nothing to worry about.

112
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,180
是不必担心  除了晨吐
Nothing to worry about outside of morning sickness,

113
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:17,870
情绪波动  背痛  还有...
mood swings, aching back and...

114
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:20,390
脚  亲爱的  你最好坐下
Feet. Darling, you should probably sit down.

115
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:24,030
别傻了  我就只觉得兴奋  快乐
Don't be silly. All I feel is excitement, happiness, and... 

116
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,830
踢了吗  这么快
Kicking? Already?

117
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,160
这感觉好奇怪
Oh, it's such a strange sensation.

118
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:30,460
有点让人躁动[振翅]
It's kind of fluttery.

119
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,300
那是我做的吗  我不是有意的
Oh, did I do that? I didn't mean to.

120
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:37,080
亲爱的
Oh. Uh, darling. 

121
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:39,040
你好  小家伙
Hello, little fella. 

122
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:43,360
如果那是第一踢
Well, if that was the first kick,

123
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,230
那说明你现在是六个月了
that puts you at about six months!

124
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:49,340
天啊  我还以为我速度快呢
Boy, oh, boy, I thought I had super speed.

125
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:52,150
我都跟不上你  别误会
I can't keep up. Please don't misinterpret.

126
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:54,610
我等不及见到你了  小比利
I can't wait to meet you, little Billy.

127
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:56,220
-比利  -嗯
- Billy? - Yeah.

128
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:57,670
我倒想起名叫汤米
Well, I was thinking Tommy.

129
00:05:57,670 --> 00:06:00,790
很经典的美国好名字
Just a nice, classic, all-American name.

130
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:02,280
汤米  嗯
Hmm, Tommy. Hmm, yeah. Yeah. 

131
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,600
不过还有比利嘛
Then there's Billy, isn't there?

132
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,860
威廉·莎士比亚的名字
Named after William Shakespeare.

133
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:06,280
"世界是个舞台
"All the world's a stage. 

134
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:08,200
男人和女人不过是演员"
All the men and women, merely players."

135
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,590
那么这场辩论只有一个解决办法了
Well, I guess there's only one solution to this debate.

136
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:12,270
希望是个女孩
Hope for a girl.

137
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:19,650
我们得快点决定了
Well, we ought to decide soon.

138
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:21,690
我估计宝宝的预产期是...
I estimate the baby's due...

139
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:24,290
进程不是常数列  如果是对数曲线
It's not a constant progression, assumingly logarithmic,

140
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:27,710
如果我要为胎儿到目前的发育过程绘制图表
but were I to graph the fetal development thus far...

141
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:29,660
你还没算出来时  他就出来了
He's gonna be here before you figure it out.

142
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:32,250
-我可以推测出比利...  -是汤米
- Nearest I can conclude is that Billy... - Tommy.

143
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:36,210
会在周五下午出生
...is due Friday afternoon.

144
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:37,470
还有三天
In three days?

145
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,480
也许我是该坐下来
Maybe I should sit down.

146
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:47,520
我觉得我们达成了共识
I think we have an understanding.

147
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:49,740
开始计时
Start the clock.

148
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:52,630
停
Time.

149
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,330
-你的个人最佳记录  -太好了
- Your personal best. - Yes!

150
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:57,250
准备是最重要的
We are nothing if not prepared.

151
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:00,030
亲爱的
Darling? 

152
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:03,150
你的书里有提到过这个吗
Do any of your books talk about this?

153
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:07,040
不疼  但是很奇怪
It's not painful, but it's strange.

154
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:09,190
-一阵紧绷的感觉吗  -没错
- A tightening sensation? - Yep, that's it.

155
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:11,390
对  在哪里  在哪里
Yes. Where was it, where was it?

156
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:15,750
"布拉克斯顿·希克斯宫缩  又名假宫缩
"Braxton Hicks contractions, also known as false labor,

157
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:17,960
通常开始于妊娠晚期
"Usually starts in the third trimester.

158
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:20,820
在1875年以约翰·布拉克斯顿·希克斯命名"
"Named after John Braxton Hicks in 1875."

159
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:21,550
亲爱的
Honey.

160
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:26,210
抱歉  好好好  太好了
Sorry. Yes. Yes. Ooh! Excellent!

161
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:29,200
我们正好趁此机会复习我们的呼吸训练
Gives us a chance to work on our breathing exercises.

162
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,400
应该这样
It should go like this.

163
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:38,350
没有用  我依然能感觉到
Yeah, it's not working. I can still feel it.

164
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:39,080
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

165
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:44,930
-这...这是怎么回事  -现在又怎么了
- What the... What the Dickens? - What's happening now?

166
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,870
赶紧放弃厨房吧
Let's abandon the kitchen.

167
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:57,410
停下了
It stopped.

168
00:07:57,650 --> 00:07:58,290
没错
Yes.

169
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:01,040
我去看看邻居们的情况下
I'll go check on the neighbors.

170
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:01,660
好
Yes.

171
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,430
菲尔
Phil?

172
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:09,550
我戴这对耳环显胖吗
Do these earrings make me look fat?

173
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:12,950
感谢上帝
Oh, thank God.

174
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,640
好像整个街区都没电了
It appears that the whole block is out.

175
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:20,340
这还只是假宫缩
Oh, and that was just a fake contraction.

176
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:23,440
等真宫缩时  天知道会发生什么
Who knows what will happen when the real thing starts.

177
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:26,290
你觉得他们知道这是我的错吗
Do you think they know it's my fault?

178
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,190
我们的邻居们吗
Our neighbors?

179
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:30,000
是啊  我们几次险些露馅
Well, yes, with all the close calls we've been having,

180
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,470
西景的居民们好像
it seems the people of Westview

181
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:34,140
一直都处于快发现我们秘密的状态中
are always on the verge of discovering our secret.

182
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:38,120
嗯  我懂你的意思
Yes, I know what you mean.

183
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:43,250
但还不仅如此  对吗
But it's more than that, isn't it?

184
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:49,220
哈特夫妇  那顿晚餐时
Mr. And Mrs. Hart, dinner.

185
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,840
刚刚在外面跟赫说话时
Outside with Herb.

186
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:57,950
我觉得这里有些不对劲  旺达
I think something's wrong here, Wanda.

187
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:04,540
嗯  我懂你的意思
Yes, I know what you mean.

188
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:10,610
事实就是  我们现在身处未知领域
The truth is, we are in unchartered waters

189
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:12,590
你知道吗
and you know what?

190
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:14,470
我也很焦虑
I'm anxious, too.

191
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,210
我们只是不知道接下来会发生什么
We just don't know what to expect.

192
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:17,940
没错
Nope.

193
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:22,770
这个孩子会是人类  还是合成人
Will the baby be human or Synthezoid?

194
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:23,660
还是说两者皆是
A bit of both?

195
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:28,760
如果他像妈妈，那比利肯定很完美
If he's anything like his ma, Billy will be perfect.

196
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:30,780
你是说汤米
You mean Tommy.

197
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:34,810
不  亲爱的  你没事吧
Oh, no, darling, are you all right?

198
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:36,870
-这次是真格的  -什么
- This is a real one! - What?

199
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:38,680
你不是说周五下午吗
I thought you said Friday afternoon!

200
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:40,300
我没想到这个图表里
Well, I didn't consider that the timings

201
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:43,470
发育阶段的时间间隔这么随意
between developmental benchmarks could be quite random!

202
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:05,520
好多了
Better.

203
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:07,890
是的  亲爱的  谢谢你  过去了
Yes, darling, thank you, it's passing.

204
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:12,880
小幻
Vis...

205
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,170
怎么了  亲爱的
Yes, dear?

206
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:16,380
我觉得我的羊水刚刚破了
I think my water just broke.

207
00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:17,620
好的  亲爱的
Yes, dear.

208
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:25,680
不不不不
No, no, no, no, no!

209
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:27,340
对不起  妈妈
Sorry, Mom. 

210
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:34,570
你需要休息一下吗
Do you need a break?

211
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:36,180
你简直能看穿我的想法
You read my mind.

212
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:37,180
跟我来
Come with me.

213
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:43,120
逃离到一个属于你自己的世界中
Escape to a world all your own,

214
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:45,520
你的麻烦全都离你远去
where your problems float away.

215
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,100
当你想要逃离
When you wanna get away, 

216
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:50,180
但却不想去任何地方时
but you don't wanna go anywhere.

217
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:56,860
{\an8}九头蛇浴
豪华沐浴粉
寻找内心的女神

218
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:57,070
九头蛇皂  寻找内心的女神
Hydra Soak, find the goddess within.

219
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:02,210
我刚刚正好读到水中生产的好处
Well, I was just reading about the advantages of water birth.

220
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:07,960
感谢上帝
Oh, thank goodness.

221
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:10,630
我扶你起来  亲爱的  来吧
Let me help you up, dear. There you go.

222
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:13,600
真是一团糟
What a mess.

223
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:22,640
这样好多了
Oh, that's better.

224
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:27,120
亲爱的  你觉得现在该...
Darling, do you think it's time to...

225
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,310
-叫医生吗  -是的
- Call the doctor? - Yeah.

226
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:29,420
我觉得没错  亲爱的
Yes, I do, dear.

227
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:31,970
该死  电话也坏了
Damn, the phones are down, too.

228
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:32,890
我最好赶紧跑着去
I better run.

229
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:35,830
但是他可能已经去度假了
Except, he might have already left for vacation.

230
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,920
去哪里  这种时候还去吗
Where? At a time like this?

231
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:39,360
说句公道话  亲爱的
Well, in fairness, darling,

232
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,400
这孩子早产了大约九个月
the baby is approximately nine months early.

233
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:43,300
我最好赶紧跑了
I better leg it.

234
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,170
你一个人没事吧
You'll be all right here?

235
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,470
好
Okay.

236
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:14,870
糟了
Oh, shoot.

237
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:24,960
旺达  你好吗
Wanda, what's up?

238
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:27,490
现在外面有23度呢
It's 75 degrees out.

239
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,230
你穿成这样是什么潮流吗
You're making a fashion statement?

240
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:32,560
杰拉丁  我现在不方便接待你
Hi, Geraldine. You know, now is not really a good time.

241
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,230
不不不  很时髦
No, no, no, it's foxy.

242
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,940
什么时候也借我穿穿
You'll have to let me borrow it sometime.

243
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:37,960
但我得先找你借个桶
But first, I gotta borrow a bucket.

244
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:40,180
不是穿的  是用的
Not to wear, to use.

245
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:42,560
不知道为什么  我家天花板上的水管
Somehow, all the pipes in my ceiling

246
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,550
突然全部都炸了  我得赶紧想想办法
burst at once and I gotta bail myself out.

247
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:46,200
是啊是啊
All right, sure.

248
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:48,010
待在那儿  不要动
Just stay right there.

249
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:50,380
我厨房里好像有个桶
I think I might have a bucket in the kitchen.

250
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:52,110
那好啊
Okay, then.

251
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:57,220
好像就在水池下面
I think it's just here under the sink!

252
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:01,620
你那边没事吧
Are you all right in there?

253
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:04,630
没事  我就是在找
Yes, I am just looking.

254
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:10,090
我来帮你
I'll come help.

255
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:12,720
不  不用了  谢谢你
No! I mean, no thank you.

256
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:18,070
找到了
Bingo.

257
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:20,430
瞧瞧啊
Would you look at that?

258
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:21,080
什么
What?

259
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:25,100
水果  旺达  谢谢
Fruit. Wanda! Thank you.

260
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,310
好吃
Yummy.

261
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:31,270
祝你早点修好漏水
Well, good luck with the leak.

262
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:36,270
那个...旺达  我想问你
Oh, that... Oh! Say, Wanda, I've got a question for you.

263
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:38,880
你知道我在打零工吧
You know how I've been working that temp job, right?

264
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:43,700
我老板哈迪克斯先生  昨天他疯了
Well, my boss, Mr. Haddox, he was going crazy yesterday...

265
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:48,000
我可真是的  说个没完
Oh, look at me going on and on

266
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,500
好像你有多闲似的
like you got all the time in the world.

267
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,590
-我这就出去...  -等等  不
- Let me go on and get out... - Wait. No.

268
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:54,590
-给我讲讲你打零工的事  -这才对嘛
- Tell me about the temp job. - Oh, that's my girl.

269
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:58,000
昨天  我老板哈迪克斯先生
So, yesterday my boss, Mr. Haddox,

270
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,220
琢磨新款早餐麦片的宣传口号
was going crazy working on the slogan

271
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:01,690
简直要想破头了
for a new breakfast cereal.

272
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:05,040
就是有棉花糖登月小人儿的那款
You know, the one with the little marshmallow Moonmen?

273
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:08,560
对对对  就是那个
Yeah, yeah, yeah, those.

274
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:12,300
还有10分钟就要正式上台展示了
So, it's 10 minutes before the big presentation,

275
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:15,130
哈迪克斯先生依然一筹莫展
and Mr. Haddox has got nothin'.

276
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:16,970
一筹莫展
Nothin', that is,

277
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:20,920
但是我从没见他打嗝这么严重过
except the worst case of hiccups I ever did see.

278
00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:24,310
旺达  他一个词都说不出来
Oh, Wanda. He couldn't get out one word,

279
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:26,050
更别提跟人推销了
let alone a whole pitch.

280
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:31,040
我试遍了各种办法  想帮他停下来
So I'm tryin' every trick in the book to help this poor man.

281
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,650
我藏在档案柜后面
I'm hidin' behind filing cabinets

282
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:37,110
在他最没防备的时候跳出来  砰
and jumpin' out when he least expects it, like, boom!

283
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:39,310
旺达
Wanda.

284
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:41,940
什么声音
What was that?

285
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:46,020
-你听到了吗  -没有
- Did you hear that? - No.

286
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:49,690
像是咔哒咔哒的声音  像...
It was like a chattering sound, like...

287
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:50,890
像这样
Like a...

288
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:53,230
对
Yeah.

289
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:56,870
那是我冰箱内置的新制冰机
That's my new ice maker built right into the fridge.

290
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:06,150
你真潮啊  那时候
You're fancy. So now, at this point,

291
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:10,960
我帮哈迪克斯先生在饮水机下倒立
I am helping Mr. Haddox do a handstand under the water cooler...

292
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:11,830
因为
because, you know,

293
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:15,830
试试倒立  也许会把嗝压下去
why not try a little upside down, drink those hiccups away.

294
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:19,930
你肯定想不到  就在那时  客户走了进来
And wouldn't you know it, in that moment, in walks the client.

295
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:21,030
不是吧
Oh, no.

296
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:23,310
是啊  但你了解我的  旺达
Oh, yes. Oh, yes. But you know me, Wanda,

297
00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:26,060
不管发生什么  我都沉着冷静
I keeps my cool, no matter what's goin' down.

298
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:27,870
所以我看着客户
So I look at the client,

299
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:32,110
我看着我旁边哈迪克斯先生双脚举在半空中
and I look at Mr. Haddox's feet floating in the air next to me,

300
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:34,510
我再回头看客户  说道
and I look back at the client, and I say,

301
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:39,270
"零重力麦片  让你以发射正姿进入新的一天"
"Gravity Os, launch into your day, the right way."

302
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:44,600
谢谢
Thank you.

303
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:47,050
哈迪克斯先生也对我说了这句话
Yes, and that's exactly what Mr. Haddox said

304
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:50,150
然后他叫我把桌子清干净
right before he told me to clean out my desk.

305
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,310
不  杰拉丁
Oh, no, Geraldine.

306
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:53,260
他不是炒了你吧
He didn't fire you.

307
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:55,240
不  宝贝
Oh, sugar.

308
00:15:55,450 --> 00:15:57,660
他是雇了我
He hired me.

309
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,010
旺达  我升职了
Oh, Wanda! I landed a promotion.

310
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:03,300
现在我是大公司白领了
And now that I've gone all corporate,

311
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:04,830
需要些办公用品
I need some office supplies.

312
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,290
这就引出了我的问题
Which brings me to my question.

313
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:08,520
你们空房里还留着那些办公用品吗
Do y'all still keep those in your spare room?

314
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:10,630
因为我指望你不会介意
Because I was hoping you wouldn't mind

315
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:13,760
-和你的好朋友分享呢  -等一下
- sharing with your good friend. - Wait. Wait.

316
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:16,950
那是我想的那东西吗
Is that what I think it is?

317
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:19,280
没错  是一只鹳  我能解释
Oh, a stork, yes, I can explain.

318
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:22,460
不  我是指摇篮
No! The crib.

319
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:26,820
出来了  宝宝要出来了
It's coming. Oh. The baby's coming.

320
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:28,330
你怀孕了吗
You're pregnant?

321
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:33,410
百慕大在等着我
Bermuda awaits

322
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:38,170
偏偏在这节骨眼我的车坏了
and my car decides to poop out right at this moment.

323
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:43,000
幻视先生  怎么了  你妻子没事吧
Whoa. Mr. Vision? What, is everything okay with the wife?

324
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,860
没事  只要我们抓紧
Yes. So long as we hurry.

325
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:50,200
可是  斯坦
But, Stan!

326
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:53,230
我还买了全新的两件式泳衣呢
What about my brand-new two-piece?

327
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:54,270
好了  旺达
Okay, Wanda.

328
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:56,750
先让你舒舒服服地躺下
Now, let's get you comfortable. Okay?

329
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,060
我就躺在这里好了
I think I'm gonna lay down right here.

330
00:16:59,070 --> 00:17:00,820
-好  -幻视跑去找医生了
- Okay. - Vision ran to get the doctor.

331
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:01,760
他很快就回来
He'll be back soon.

332
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:04,030
不  时间不够了
No, no, there's not enough time for that.

333
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:05,490
放松  放松
Relax. Relax.

334
00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:08,760
你知道怎么控制呼吸吧
You know your breathing, right?

335
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:10,770
旺达  我听不见
Wanda, I can't hear you.

336
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:20,410
虽然我来得比较晚
I may be late to the party,

337
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:23,230
但我猜这种情况应该是合理的吧
but I imagine there is a logical explanation for this.

338
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:25,390
这一切都正常得很
It's all perfectly natural!

339
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:26,730
你做得很好
Hey, you're doing great.

340
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:28,970
你做得很好  看着我  看着我
You're doing great. Look at me. Look at me.

341
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:30,870
跟我做
Come on.

342
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,810
我做不到
I can't do this.

343
00:17:33,810 --> 00:17:35,090
你当然可以
Yes, you can.

344
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,780
我做不到  真的
I can't. I can't.

345
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:38,140
你能做到
You can do this.

346
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:41,280
你能  你一定能做到
Yes, you can. You can do this.

347
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:43,820
该开始用力推了
It's time to start pushing.

348
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,120
你准备好了吗  你准备好了  准备好了
You ready? You're ready. You're ready.

349
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:50,240
推  推  旺达  用力推
Push. Push, Wanda. Push!

350
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:53,660
推  好样的
Push! That a girl.

351
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,800
是男孩
It's a boy.

352
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,280
他真完美
Oh, he's perfect.

353
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:25,480
不  我错过了
Oh, no. I missed it.

354
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:34,020
医生  能不能来厨房帮我一下
Hey, Doc, why don't you help me out in the kitchen there?

355
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:37,990
我们走得太快了  就像是在飞一样
We went so fast, it was like we were flying.

356
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:42,330
你太棒了  旺达
Well done, Wanda.

357
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:50,440
你想不想用自己的面目看看你的儿子
Well, don't you wanna meet your son as yourself?

358
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:02,110
你很强壮
Ooh. You're strong.

359
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,600
你好呀  小汤米
Hello there, little Tommy.

360
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:10,150
汤米
Tommy?

361
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:13,250
对  汤米
Yes, Tommy.

362
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,270
怎么了
What? 

363
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:21,160
我的天
Good heavens!

364
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,250
还有另一个宝宝
There's another baby coming.

365
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:25,470
比利
Billy?

366
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:28,350
旺达  用力  用力
Wanda, push! Push!

367
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:37,370
两双手两双脚
Twenty fingers and 20 toes.

368
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:41,400
你们生下了两个非常健康的男孩
You've got two healthy baby boys on your hands.

369
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,530
-谢谢你  医生  -没事
- Thank you, Doctor. - Yeah.

370
00:19:42,530 --> 00:19:43,930
常规操作[只用了一天]
All in a day's work.

371
00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:47,910
也谢谢你的帮助  女士
And thank you for your assistance, young lady.

372
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:51,250
我觉得你很有做护士的天赋
I think you might have what it takes to be a nurse.

373
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:54,320
我送你出去吧  医生
Allow me to walk you out, Doctor.

374
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:59,360
好的  只要这次我们用走的
Oh, all right. As long as we actually walk this time.

375
00:19:59,410 --> 00:20:00,430
走吧
Come.

376
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:07,610
我欠你一个大人情
I do owe you a debt of gratitude.

377
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:10,200
尼尔森医生
Well, Dr. Nielson,

378
00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:13,030
希望你还能赶上你的旅行
I hope you're still able to make your trip.

379
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:15,450
对了  我的旅行
Ah, yes, my trip.

380
00:20:15,530 --> 00:20:18,290
我觉得我们可能去不了了
I don't think we'll get away after all.

381
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:22,720
这是个小城镇  你懂得  很难...
Small towns, you know. So hard to...

382
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:24,770
逃离
Escape.

383
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:30,940
好吧
Yeah.

384
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:34,170
她在里面干什么呢
What is she doing in there?

385
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:34,710
-我不知道  -你好啊
- I don't know. - Howdy!

386
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:36,060
-你好  艾格妮丝  -你好
- Hey! Agnes. - Howdy!

387
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,300
你看见她进去了吗
Did you see her go inside?

388
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,970
她进去了
She went right in.

389
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:43,460
她的肚子  杰拉丁是不是
And her tummy was... Did Geraldine...

390
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:45,680
今天可真是太神奇了  对吧
Remarkable day we're having, no?

391
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:48,110
-没事  -你们家也停电了吗
- That's fine. - Did you lose power, too?

392
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,620
是呀
Oh, sure did.

393
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:52,550
但拉夫在黑暗里看起来更帅  所以没关系
But Ralph looks better in the dark, so I'm not complaining.

394
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:54,980
你好  赫
Hi, Herb.

395
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:56,430
你好啊  伙计
Hey, buddy.

396
00:20:58,550 --> 00:20:59,530
好吧
Okay.

397
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:02,530
我要回去找旺达了
Well, I'll get back to Wanda.

398
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:04,390
幻视
Vision.

399
00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:09,430
杰拉丁是不是跟旺达在里面
Is Geraldine inside with Wanda?

400
00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:12,020
是  怎么了
Yes. Why?

401
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,130
你真是太坚强了
You're such a strong lady.

402
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:19,940
真是不敢相信  双胞胎
Can you believe it? Twins!

403
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,890
我也是双胞胎
I'm a twin.

404
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:29,920
我曾经也有一个弟弟
I had a brother.

405
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:34,100
他叫皮特
His name was Pietro.

406
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:08,140
他是被奥创杀死的  对吗
He was killed by Ultron, wasn't he?

407
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,770
你说什么
What did you say?

408
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:16,190
她是才来到镇上的  是个新人
She's new to town. Brand-new.

409
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,590
她没有家人
There's no family.

410
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:21,120
没有丈夫
No husband.

411
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:23,080
这也没什么不对吧
Well, there's nothing wrong with that.

412
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:28,120
也没有家
No home.

413
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:31,360
什么
What?

414
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:39,370
你刚刚说什么
What did you say just now?

415
00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:45,710
我说  旺达
I said, Wanda,

416
00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:48,670
你真是太坚强了
you're such a strong lady.

417
00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:51,440
我应该再多夸你一次吗
Should I say it one more time for good measure?

418
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,470
不
No.

419
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,080
你刚刚说皮特什么
What did you say about Pietro?

420
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:59,000
皮特
Pietro?

421
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:05,880
我来替你摇一会儿宝宝们吧
Hey, I'll take a shift rocking the babies.

422
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,450
不  我觉得你应该离开了
No, I think you should leave.

423
00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:09,570
旺达  别这样
Oh, Wanda, don't be like that.

424
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,800
什么叫她没有家
What do you mean, she has no home?

425
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,330
她来这儿是因为
